# Nudge On Grid (Sketch Plugin)

### Description

Move and resize layers on the grid (View > Canvas > Grid Settings).

It's different from the default behaviour:

1. The plugin adapts to your grid settings. Sketch is hardcoded to 1px or 10px. Hi 8px!
2. The plugin will move layers _on the grid_. 

  For example: If your grid size is 8px then 35px would increase to 40px and 40px would increase to 48px. Sketch would increase 35px to 43px.
